Difference between window, screen and document in JavaScript ?
Answer: 
Window --> is the topmost object of the DOM (Document Object Mode) hierarchy. 
           It represent a browser window or frame that display the contents of the webpage.

Screen --> window.screen or screen is just information about actual screen dimensions.

Document --> it represent a webpage that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we
             can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document, we can add dynamic content 
             to our webpage.
